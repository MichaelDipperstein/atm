<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ATM Simulation Design Document<BR>
Kevin O'Gorman<BR>
Michael Dipperstein<BR>
CS 274</H3>

<H4>Overview</H4>

<P>The ATM Simulation program will consist of three independent components:
the User Interface, the Web-Monitor, and the Data Repositories (Bank Branches).
The components of the ATM Simulation are layered such that the User Interface
lies on top of the Web-Monitor, which lies on top of the Data Repositories.
Each component of the ATM Simulation will communicate only with the component
layered above it and the component layered below it. Each component will
also be designed so that it may be monitored and debugged through a web
browser outside of the regular program operation. </P>

<P>To the extent possible, the implementation will observe the WWW paradigm
of stateless interactions. To this end, there will be no persistent process
running on behalf of this application. Code will execute only on behalf
of web page &quot;hits&quot;, and will never intentionally enter an inaccessible
&quot;wait state&quot;. Persistent state information will be maintained
as SYSV shared-memory segments with SYSV semaphore mutexes, and by
the use of HTML hidden fields in the transmitted web pages.</P>

<P>All program components in this project will be implemented in Perl.
</P>

<H4>User Interface</H4>

<P>The User Interface is responsible for presenting transaction information
to the ATM Simulation user. It will present the user with transaction options
and forward requests to the Web-Monitor. The user interface is also responsible
for receiving updates from the Web-Monitor and displaying them for the
user. The User Interface will actually be the HTML output of a single Web-Monitor
CGI script, which will give the user the illusion of separate HTML pages.
Each Web page may contain one or more hidden fields to identify the
subject transaction and its persistent state. Communication between the
User Interface and the user will be through a Web Browser.</P>

<P>The User Interface consists of a single main page, on which the user
may indicate accounts to be included in the transaction and the actions
to be taken. There will also be the appearance of other pages for handling
error conditions. </P>

<P>User input to the main page will consist of account numbers and dollar
amounts to apply to each account. The page will display identifying
information about the accounts identified by the user, and the total cash
(in to teller, out to customer) of the transaction, and status information
about the transaction. There will be user-selectable buttons to allow the
user to accept (commit) or abort the transaction. The only valid transaction
will be a combination of:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Inquire of an account</LI>

<LI>Deposit to account</LI>

<LI>Withdraw from account</LI>

<LI>Transfer between accounts</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Web-Monitor</H4>

<P>The Web-Monitor is responsible for maintaining a consistent scheduling
policy, Data Repository updates, and User Interface updates. The Web-Monitor
provides an interface that allows only deposit, withdrawal, and transfer
of money. Account creation and deletion are not provided. The Web-Monitor
allows inquiry to a number of accounts and money activity among the accounts.
</P>

<P>The Web-Monitor will interact with the Data Repositories by opening
a TCP socket to port 80 on www.cs.ucsb.edu, thereby emulating a browser.
The same effect can be seen by using a UNIX telnet session to the current
data repository code as follows: </P>

<PRE>   telnet www.cs.ucsb.edu 80
   GET /cgi-bin/kogorman/bank.pl?bank=0&amp;account=0-0&amp;send=Get HTTP/1.0

followed by two newlines. </PRE>

<P>It is anticipated that the User Interface and the Web Monitor will be
implemented by separate sections of a single Perl script. </P>

<H5>Scheduling Policy</H5>

<P>Scheduling will be strict 2PL with a &quot;wound/ask&quot; deadlock
policy. This policy involves timestamping each lock. Timestamps will be
stored in the form of seconds since epoch. The timestamp will be used to
enforce a lazy timeout if a lock is held for a small number of minutes.
When a conflict is detected, one of two cases holds: </P>

<UL>
<P>(1) if the lock has been held for longer than the allowed duration,
its transaction will be removed from the list of active transactions, and
the lock request granted. All locks held by the wounded transaction will
be released. </P>

<P>(2) if the lock is recent, the user requesting the conflicting lock
will be asked to try again or elect to abort.</P>
</UL>

<P>Thus aborts can be either inflicted on a transaction, or selected by
the user. In the event that a transaction is aborted due to lock timeout,
the Web-Monitor will notify the User Interface of the wounded transaction
the next time an operation is submitted for that transaction. This policy
addresses the very real WWW phenomenon of loss of connection, and
thus a transaction that will never complete on its own; in this system,
such transactions will eventually be &quot;wounded&quot; when their expired
locks cause a conflict, and they will be cleared from the system.</P>

<P>Saved state for the Web-Monitor consists of a transaction list, a lock
table, and cached values of all pending data updates. Data are not written
to the persistent database (data repositories) until transaction commit.
The saved state information is maintained in SYSV shared memory, protected
by a SYSV semaphore, both with ID 27150. </P>

<H5>Transaction List</H5>

<P>The transaction list contains a next transaction number to assign, and
a list of active transactions. Any transaction not in the active transaction
list has either been committed, aborted, or never created. All operations
by transaction not in the active transaction list will be prohibited.</P>

<P>For each active transaction, a &quot;step number&quot; is maintained
to prevent a user from using the &quot;back&quot; key on a browser to alter
the flow of control. This step number encodes sequence of operations and
the next functional element to be accessed. Any out of sequence operation
will result in the aborting of the transaction.</P>

<H5>Lock Table</H5>

<P>The lock table is a hash, keyed on account numbers and lock types. Each
entry contains the account number, the type of lock, the transaction number,
and the timestamp. The only lock types allowed are read locks and write
locks. Account inquiries require read locks, while deposits, withdrawals,
and transfers require write locks. Lock conflicts and their resolution
is discussed under Scheduling Policy.</P>

<H4>Data Repositories (Bank Branches)</H4>

<P>There will be 10 Data Repositories, simulating 10 bank branches. The
data for each branch will be implemented as a SYSV shared memory segment.
Segment IDs 27140-27149 will be arbitrarily assigned to a branch, although
this is changeable. Access to the data will be protected by a mutex, implemented
as 10 SYSV semaphores in a single segment numbered 27140. There will be
one semaphore per bank branch. </P>

<P>A single CGI script will implement interactions with the branch data,
allowing the following functions: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Open account</LI>

<LI>Inquire of account</LI>

<LI>Deposit to account</LI>

<LI>Withdraw from account</LI>
</UL>

<P>These functions will perform basic validity checks and input editing,
but will impose no scheduling or authentication services. </P>

<P>Bank branches are numbered from 0 to 9, and account numbers contain
the branch number (as is common with banks). The first account assigned
to branch 5 will be account 5-0, the second 5-1, and so on. </P>

<P>Branch data consists of the next account number to assign, and account
information for each account. These are kept in the shared memory as a
simple text region with a leading binary length field. There is one line
for the next account number, and one line per account. The line for each
account comprises four colon-separated fields. The data take the form shown
below (except that spaces have been added for clarity): </P>

<UL>
<P>&lt;LENGTH&gt; <BR>
nextaccount <BR>
account-number : account-name : account-ssan : account-balance <BR>
account-number : account-name : account-ssan : account-balance <BR>
account-number : account-name : account-ssan : account-balance <BR>
.<BR>
.<BR>
.</P>
</UL>

<P>The account information is not sorted (the lines may appear in any order).
The hidden fields and the shared-memory segments together comprise all
the saved state that is preserved between web page hits by the data repositories.
</P>
