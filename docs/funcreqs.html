<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>The goal of our project is to provide demonstrate Web-based network
database transaction. Our project will provide multiple web browser users
with an interface which allows transactions similar to those provided by
an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The maximum number of users will be
limited by the web server hosting this application, not the application
itself. The users will be allowed to deposit, withdraw, and transfer balances
between bank accounts held at different banks. A database of each bank's
accounts will be stored in independent web accessible databases. The bank
databases will be hidden from the user of the ATM simulation, but
may be viewed in by a separate web browser session to verify correctness
of the simulation.</p>

<h4>Start Up</h4>

<p>The ATM simulation program may be started by opening the simulation's
home page in a web browser. Upon start up, the user will be presented with
an informational display and prompted to either request an account balance
for one or two accounts. To make a balance inquiry, the user must enter
the account number(s) the balance is desired for and select the Balance
button on his display. (For this simulation, account numbers will be unique
between banks, thus eliminating the need for a bank name to be provided
with the account number.) Making the balance inquiry has the additional
side effect of an implied begin transaction, therefor a new transaction
will be started for each entry made form the simulation's home page.</p>

<p>If the balance inquiry successfully returns the account balance(s),
the user will be allowed to request a deposit, withdrawl, or balance transfer.
The user will be provided a display with the balance and prompted for the
next action. If the inquiry fails, the transaction will be aborted. The
user will be prompted with a failure indication, and then returned to the
simulation's home page.</p>

<h4>Deposit</h4>

<p>Once a successful balance inquiry has been completed, the user may choose
to deposit money in the account of the inquiry. To deposit money into the
account, the user must enter the amount of the deposit and choose the Deposit
button on his display. The Deposit button will only be presented if the
user is in a state where deposits are allowed.</p>

<p>Sending the deposit request has the additional side effect of an implied
end transaction. If the deposit attempt is successful, the user will be
given a success message and the after deposit account balance. If the deposit
attempt is not successful, the user will be informed of the failure and
returned to the home page.</p>

<h4>Withdrawl</h4>

<p>Once a successful balance inquiry has been completed, the user may choose
to withdraw money from the account of the inquiry. To withdraw money from
the account, the user must enter the amount of the withdrawl and choose
the Withdraw button on his display. The Withdrawl button will only be presented
if the user is in a state where withdrawals are allowed.</p>

<p>Sending the withdrawl request has the additional side effect of an implied
end transaction. If the withdrawl attempt is successful, the user will
be given a success message and the after withdrawl account balance. If
the withdrawl attempt is not successful, the user will be informed of the
failure and returned to the home page. A withdrawl request which would
cause a balance to go negative will not be allowed to succeed.</p>

<h4>Transfer</h4>

<p>Once a successful balance inquiry has been completed for two accounts,
the user may choose to transfer money from the first account of the inquiry
to the second. To transfer money from the first account, the user must
enter the amount of the transfer and choose the Transfer button on his
display. The Transfer button will only be presented if the user is in a
state where transfers are allowed.</p>

<p>Sending the transfer request has the additional side effect of an implied
end transaction. If the transfer attempt is successful, the user will be
given a success message and the after transfer account balance of both
accounts. If the withdrawl attempt is not successful, the user will be
informed of the failure and returned to the home page. A transfer request
which would cause a balance of the account transferred from to go negative
will not be allowed to succeed. It is not necessary for the accounts involve
in the transfer to belong to the same bank in order for the transfer to
succeed.</p>

<h4>Aborting Transaction</h4>

<p>The user my abort a transaction by pressing the Abort button on his
display. A transaction may be aborted by the user anytime between starting
up and sending a deposit, withdrawl, or transfer request. These operations
may not be aborted once they are forwarded to the transaction manager since
they contain implied commits. Once a transaction is aborted the user will
be transitioned back to the start up display where he may choose to start
begin another transaction or perform another action with his web browser.</p>
