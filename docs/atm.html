<P>The World Wide Web as implemented in HTML offers great promise and presents
significant obstacles for distributed database access. This project explores
some of both. Of particular interest is the HTTP paradigm of connectionless
and nominally stateless interactions. We decided to stay within the spirit
of these limitations by using static HTML interactions, driven entirely
by Perl CGI scripts, and to perform scheduling without any persistent process.
Transaction state was preserved between HTTP interactions in order to provide
continuity and to inform the scheduling decisions. The project implements
an interface for banking transactions against accounts in multiple bank
branches. Two versions were implemented, one using strict 2PL scheduling,
and one using the lessons of the first to implement using a more sophisticated
deadlock resolution scheme and semantic&shy;based scheduler. To varying
degrees, the two versions deal with correctness, concur&shy; rency, deadlock,
livelock, and garbage&shy;collection issues, some of which are peculiar
to the HTTP environment.</P>

<H4>1 The Application</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We implemented a bank teller's interface
to bank branch data, with the ability to enter transactions which involve
any combination of cash received, deposit or withdrawal to as many as eight
of the accounts at ten bank branches, and cash returned to a customer.
The system imposes application consistency constraints on the transaction
which would be expected in a banking environment.</P>

<H4>2 The Implementations</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the teller interface and the bank
branches are implemented as web pages, and can be used by e.g. a Netscape
browser. The human&shy;accessible interface consists of three WWW access
points: </P>

<UL>
<LI>A bank branch selector page, with links to each of ten bank branches.

<H4>2.1 Methodology</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interaction with the user is entirely
in standard HTML. The illusion of multiple web pages is provided by the
use of CGI programming. In fact all pages are produced on the fly by the
programs.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All coding was done in Perl. Frequent reference
was made to [WCS91] and [Gun96].<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System V IPC implementation required Perl
versions of system header files. These were produced in two versions, one
for Linux for use during development and one for Solaris to be used on
the campus machines. These were created from the system header (.h) files
by the utility h2ph provided with Perl.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the CGI interface code was simplified
by using utility programs provided on the web page for the CGI reference
[Gun96]. The programs mime.pl and common.pl were obtained from that source.</P>

<H3>2.2 The Constraints</H3>

<P>We chose to work within constraints of standard HTML, and consistent
with a financial application. The primary constraints imposed by HTML were:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The several user interactions of a transaction are performed without
a connection; as a result the application cannot determine if a user has
become disconnected. Although we were permitted by the problem to assume
to failures, we considered dropped connections so much a feature of the
WWW that we treated the problem of a disconnected transaction. We will
discuss this more completely in Section 2.3.</LI>

<LI>The interactions of HTTP are to a certain extent stateless; in any
event there is no persistent process waiting for, and timing out for lack
of, resposes from the user. As a result we used hidden fields in web pages
to identify a transaction, and kept state information on the transaction
at the server.</LI>

<LI>The lack of a persistent process prevents the use of true timeouts.
We used an approach that uses timestamps to achieve much the same effect
as timeouts.</LI>

<LI>Browsers generally have a &quot;Back&quot; key or something similar.
This poses problems of synchronization of the user's view of the transaction
with the saved state. We decided to detect synchronization changes and
to abort transactions when this was detected.</LI>

<LI>Browsers can send multiple requests when the user presses a button
multiple times before receiving a reply. This can also cause lost synchronization
and in all cases where it mattered, we also aborted the transaction.</LI>

<LI>The look&shy;and&shy;feel of the WWW dictates that the server process
never wait on behalf of a user; some form of reply is sent as soon as possible.
We chose to observe this discipline, with the result that all waiting is
done by the user. In the event of a lock conflict, first the deadlock resolution
methods are tried, and if the conflict persists, the user is given a response
that indicates that some part of the requested transaction cannot be honored.
This usually takes the form of a message like &quot;Cannot read lock&quot;
or &quot;Cannot hold $500.00&quot;.</LI>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our application is dealing with
dollar amounts and account balances, we imposed constraints suggested by
this environment:</P>

<UL>
<LI>No account balance is allowed to be negative.</LI>

<LI>No transaction is allowed to commit while requesting a change that
would cause an account balance to be negative. </LI>

<LI>The sum of dollars in (cash and checks) plus account activity must
not be negative, although it can be positive to reflect the normal bank
practice of allowing partial deposits accompanied by cash back to a customer.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>2.3 Deadlock and Livelock</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both versions of the bank teller interface
use schedulers that can have deadlock. The two versions use different resolution
methods, but both rely on timestamps to simulate timeouts. In both versions,
any acquired lock has a timestamp that is set when the lock is first acquired.
If the lock becomes older than a systemwide value (currently 3 minutes
for demonstration purposes), any conflicting lock will assume that deadlock
has occurred.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variant of &quot;wound&shy;wait&quot; timeout&shy;based
deadlock detection is used. We call this variation &quot;wound&shy;ask&quot;
because the user is presented with a page indicating the lock, and providing
an opportunity to change the transaction, retry the request, or abort.
The waiting is done in the cycle of user requests to retry, but may be
resolved in the other indicated ways.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first version, because of concerns
mentioned above about disconnected users, any conflict with a lock that
is older than the system limit (3 minutes) causes the transaction with
the stale lock to be wounded. In this way, any abandoned or disconnected
transaction is prevented from deadlocking the entire application. However,
this approach can in principle lead to livelock, where a transaction is
repeatedly wounded and never proceeds to completion.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to deal with this potential livelock,
the second version uses a timestamp on each transaction to determine which
is the &quot;older&quot;, and normally only the younger transaction is
wounded. Since provision is made to restart the wounded transaction with
the same timestamp, livelock is avoided in this case.</P>

<H4>2.4 Lock Semantics</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first version, locking is standard
strict 2PL, with read and write operations, and single account granularity.
We considered this inconsistent with normal banking practice, which uses
the concept of a &quot;hold&quot; on part of the balance of an account
without affecting the remainder of the balance.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the second version uses only
increment (deposit) and decrement (withdrawal) operations on the accounts.
In the absence of the constraints of Section 2.2, this would have allowed
us to dispense with locks altogether. However, the constraint that account
balances not be allowed to become negative leads to a requirement to implement
locks much like the &quot;holds&quot; familiar to bankers. Such locks are
in effect write&shy;locks on a certain portion of an account, and locks
conflict when they would amount to more than the committed balance of an
account.</P>

<H4>3 Saved State</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three application sections use SYSV
IPC to save state. That is, the each bank branch uses a shared memory segment
to save accounts and balances, and each of the two teller implementations
uses a shared memory segment for transaction state. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank branch data has been alive on the campus
web server since early May. It has not required rebuilding in that time.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each shared memory segment was set to a size
of 10000 bytes, which has been more than adequate for testing.</P>

<H4>4 Garbage Collection</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saved state for the teller interface
may include data for abandoned or disconnected transactions. This became
a problem for debugging because dumps of the data were getting confusing.
Accordingly, the second version implements a garbage collector that uses
an activity timestamp on each transaction in the saved state.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that any transaction on which
there has been no progress (no interaction with the user) in a specified
period will be aborted by the next transaction that does make progress.
The time limit is set to 15 minutes for demonstration purposes.</P>

<H4>5 Conclusion</H4>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have implemented two versions of the
banking application. The first, while correct, was primarily a learning
experience for the team.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second version has several improvements
on the first:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Livelock&shy;free deadlock resolution through the use of transaction
timestamps.</LI>

<LI>Increment/decrement semantics for reduced transaction conflict</LI>

<LI>Recovery of wounded transactions without user retyping</LI>

<LI>Garbage collection of saved state</LI>
